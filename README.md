# robotEngine
This is a program written for Arduino Pro Micro that can be used to mix the outputs of a three channel RC receiver to the tank steering used in most combat robots.

I am using robotEngine in my beetleweight combat robot Impulse Response.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code, but if you do something cool with it, let me know!
